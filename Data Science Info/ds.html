        <h2>What is Data Science?</h2>
        <p>Data science is a deep study of the massive amount of data, which involves extracting meaningful insights from raw, structured, and unstructured data that is processed using the scientific method, different technologies, and algorithms.
            <br><br>
            It is a multidisciplinary field that uses tools and techniques to manipulate the data so that you can find something new and meaningful.
            <br><br>
            Data science uses the most powerful hardware, programming systems, and most efficient algorithms to solve the data related problems. It is the future of artificial intelligence.
            <br><br>
            In short, we can say that data science is all about:
            <br><br>
            ~ Asking the correct questions and analyzing the raw data. <br>
            ~ Modeling the data using various complex and efficient algorithms. <br>
            ~ Visualizing the data to get a better perspective. <br>
            ~ Understanding the data to make better decisions and finding the final result.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
            <p>Let suppose we want to travel from station A to station B by car. Now, we need to take some decisions such as which route will be the best route to reach faster at the location, in which route there will be no traffic jam, and which will be cost-effective. All these decision factors will act as input data, and we will get an appropriate answer from these decisions, so this analysis of data is called the data analysis, which is a part of data science.</p>

            <strong><h3>Data science Jobs</h3></strong>
            <p>As per various surveys, data scientist job is becoming the most demanding Job of the 21st century due to increasing demands for data science. Some people also called it "the hottest job title of the 21st century". Data scientists are the experts who can use various statistical tools and machine learning algorithms to understand and analyze the data.
                <br><br>
                The average salary range for data scientist will be approximately $95,000 to $ 165,000 per annum, and as per different researches, about 11.5 millions of job will be created by the year 2026.

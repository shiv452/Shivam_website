            <p><strong>Software Testing:</strong>Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. The benefits of testing include preventing bugs, reducing development costs and improving performance.</p>
            <p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 55, 255); margin-left: 20px;">Software testing can be divided into two steps:</strong>
                <br>1. <strong>Verification:</strong> it refers to the set of tasks that ensure that the software correctly implements a specific function.</p>
            <p>2. <strong>Validation:</strong> it refers to a different set of tasks that ensure that the software that has been built is traceable to customer requirements.</p>
            <p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 55, 255); margin-left: 20px;">What are different types of software testing?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Software Testing can be broadly classified into two types:&nbsp;</p>
            <p>1. <strong>Manual Testing:</strong> Manual testing includes testing software manually, i.e., without using any automation tool or any script. In this type, the tester takes over the role of an end-user and tests the software to identify any unexpected behavior or bug. There are different stages for manual testing such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.</p>
            <p>Testers use test plans, test cases, or test scenarios to test software to ensure the completeness of testing. Manual testing also includes exploratory testing, as testers explore the software to identify errors in it.</p>
            <p>2. <strong>Automation Testing:</strong> Automation testing, which is also known as Test Automation, is when the tester writes scripts and uses another software to test the product. This process involves the automation of a manual process. Automation Testing is used to re-run the test scenarios quickly and repeatedly, that were performed manually in manual testing.</p>
            <p>Apart from regression testing, automation testing is also used to test the application from a load, performance, and stress point of view. It increases the test coverage, improves accuracy, and saves time and money when compared to manual testing.</p>
            <p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 55, 255); margin-left: 20px;">What are the different types of Software Testing Techniques ?</strong></p>
            <p>Software testing techniques can be majorly classified into two categories:</p>
            <p>1.<strong> Black Box Testing:</strong> The technique of testing in which the tester doesn’t have access to the source code of the software and is conducted at the software interface without any concern with the internal logical structure of the software is known as black-box testing.</p>
            <p>2. <strong>White-Box Testing:</strong> The technique of testing in which the tester is aware of the internal workings of the product, has access to its source code, and is conducted by making sure that all internal operations are performed according to the specifications is known as white box testing.</p>
            <p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 55, 255); margin-left: 20px;">What are different levels of software testing?</strong></p>
            <p>Software level testing can be majorly classified into 4 levels:</p>
            <p>1. <strong>Unit Testing:</strong> A level of the software testing process where individual units/components of a software/system are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.</p>
            <p>2. <strong>Integration Testing:</strong> A level of the software testing process where individual units are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.</p>
            <p>3. <strong>System Testing:</strong> A level of the software testing process where a complete, integrated system/software is tested. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the specified requirements.</p>
            <p>4. <strong>Acceptance Testing:</strong> A level of the software testing process where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.</p>
